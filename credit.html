            <div class="content">
                <p id="para-of-question">A Credit Card is a facility offered by banks and financial institutions
                    allowing you to make online as well as physical purchases without needing to exchange hard currency.

                    A credit card is a thin rectangular piece of plastic or metal issued by a bank or financial services
                    company, that allows cardholders to borrow funds with which to pay for goods and services with
                    merchants that accept cards for payment. Credit cards impose the condition that cardholders pay back
                    the borrowed money, plus any applicable interest, as well as any additional agreed-upon charges,
                    either in full by the billing date or over time.

                How do Credit Card works?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p id="para-of-question"> Credit Cards work on the ‘Buy now and Pay later’ principle. It is a
                    straightforward process. Every Credit Card comes with a prescribed limit. If the threshold is
                    available at the time of your purchase, the bank approves the payment. The bank raises the bill on
                    the fixed date. You have to make the payment on or before the due date mentioned in the statement.
                </p>

                What are the benefit using Credit Card?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p id="para-of-question"> Credit Cards are the perfect alternative to cash. There is no need of carrying
                    large amounts of money when you have a Credit Card.

                    You get an interest-free window depending on the date of billing and the due date. The maximum
                    interest-free period is between 52 and 55 days.

                    Credit cardholders can avail cash advance facility on an urgent basis. Every Credit Card comes with
                    a cash advance limit. Note that this is not an interest-free advance. You have to pay interest on
                    the cash advance portion from day 1.

                    You can own a Credit Card and enjoy various benefits that come with it such as bonus points, gift
                    vouchers, rewards programs, cashback benefits, and multiple other benefits.

                    Banks allow credit cardholders to apply for add-on cards for their family members. They can use
                    these cards on an individual basis.

                    Banks issue unique Credit Cards that allow the cardholders to avail travel benefits like air miles,
                    airport lounge access, airline offers, hotel offers, and travel insurance. These cards are also
                    known as Co-branded Credit Cards.

                    Some Credit Cards come with lifestyle benefits like dining, shopping, entertainment, and wellness
                    and so forth.

                    Many banks offer fuel surcharge waivers to their credit cardholders.

                    Proper usage of the Credit Card can improve your credit history.

                    Today, you have international Credit Cards that allow you to make payments in foreign currency. You
                    can also withdraw cash in foreign currency when you travel abroad.

                    There are Credit Cards that come with general insurance coverage. Some cards come with lost card
                    liability or insurance to protect the cardholders from missing cards and forged transactions.

            <label class="label" for="Fifth">Some Facts about Credit Cards</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p id="para-of-question">1. Credit Card Numbers

                    Every Credit Card number has 16 digits

                    The first digit on the card represents the system, for example 3 for Travel or Entertainment card, 4
                    for Visa Card, 5 for MasterCard, and 6 for Discover card.

                    The American Express Card starts with 37 while the Diner’s Club card begins with 38

                    Every card has a CVV (Card Verification Value) number written on the reverse side of the card. It is
                    usually a 3-digit number. American Express cards have a 4-digit CVV number embossed on the face of
                    the card. The CVV number is an anti-fraud security feature.

                    Banks issue the PIN (Personal Identification Number) for every Credit Card. You should change the
                    PIN after the first usage. It is a security feature. You will have to enter this number during every
                    card transaction.

                    Nowadays, you have a second layer of security available when you use Credit Cards online. You can
                    set up an individual six-digit PIN to verify your transactions online. Alternatively, you can seek
                    an OTP (One Time Password) number for every purchase you do online. Banks send this OTP to your
                    registered mobile or email id.

                    2. Reward Programs

                    Reward Points – Every transaction on your Credit Card can earn reward points. You can redeem them
                    subsequently and enjoy attractive offers.

                    Indian Oil Card – This card is beneficial to people who spend a lot on petrol. This card gives you
                    the facility of paying for petrol with reward points.

                    Shopping Cards – This is an ideal card for people who love shopping. You have access to various
                    discounts and offers.

                    Cashback Credit Card – This type of card entitles you to receive cashback offers on specific
                    purchases you make.

                    Airlines Credit Card – Frequent flyers can use this Credit Card to get attractive discounts and
                    redeemable mileage points on individual

                    3. Credit Card Limits

                    Every Credit Card has a revolving credit limit. Banks approve these limits based on your
                    eligibility. You cannot use the card for amounts exceeding your limit. The banks review the limits
                    at the time of renewal. Based on the usage and repayment history, banks can enhance or reduce the
                    limit.

                    4. Minimum Payment Due

                    It is an essential concept. Credit Cards allow you an interest-free period ranging from 20 days to
                    around 52 to 55 days depending on the billing cycle. Every month the bank submits the bill for
                    payment. You should pay the entire balance to take advantage of the interest-free period in the
                    subsequent billing cycle. However, you can opt to make a part-payment of the bill. Every bill has a
                    minimum payment due (usually 5% of the outstanding amount) amount. You can pay an amount equal to or
                    more than the minimum payment due to enjoy the Credit Card limits. The difference between the bill
                    amount and the payment you make is subject to interest in the range of 3% to 3.5% per month

            <div class="content">
                <p id="para-of-question"> Joining fee – Usually, banks do not charge any joining fee. They provide the
                    card free for the first year. Subsequently, they charge renewal fees annually. Certain banks charge
                    joining fees.

                    Renewal fees – There is an annual renewal fee on the card after the first year.

                    Interest – Every card has an interest-free period depending on the billing cycle and the due date
                    for repayment. Usually, it is around 20 days to a maximum of 52 or 55 days. If you make the full
                    payment on or before the due date, there is no interest. However, if you make a part-payment, the
                    balance amount will attract interest. These rates vary from bank to bank. Usually, it is in the
                    range of 3% to 3.5% per month.

                    Cash withdrawal fee – You have a cash withdrawal limit on your Credit Card. This facility allows you
                    to withdraw cash in an emergency from any compatible ATM. Banks charge a cash withdrawal fee on
                    every withdrawal. This cash advance facility attracts interest from day 1.
