                <p id="para-of-question">A Home Loan is finance provided by a bank or a financial institution to enable
                    its customers to purchase or construct or improve their homes.

            <div class="content">
                <p id="para-of-question"> Buying a home could be one of the biggest achievements of a person’s life. In
                    most cases, it takes an entire lifespan to fulfil the dream of purchasing one’s own home. Selecting
                    the ideal property involves a lot of research and planning. Arranging funds is probably the toughest
                    and the trickiest part of the process.

                    You could dip into your savings for the entire payment or decide to get a Home Loan at a good
                    interest rate.

                    A decade or so earlier, borrowing from a bank used to be a cumbersome process but today financial
                    institutions have simplified the entire Home Loan application and disbursement process. All leading
                    financial institutions offer Home Loans with attractive interest rates, flexible repayment periods,
                    quick turnaround times and unique product features.

                    Before finalising on a lender, one must understand the intricacies of a Home Loan.
                    How should I compare what each bank is offering me? Is there anything in the fine print I should be
                    worried about?

            <label class="label" for="Third">Benefits of availing a Home Loan</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p id="para-of-question"> An accomplishment – Every individual dreams of owning a house in their name. A
                    home loan allows you to accomplish this feat and realize your dreams. This is one of the biggest
                    financial investments you make in your lifetime and can therefore be considered an accomplishment.

                    Capital appreciation- Land is an appreciating asset in most cases. Construction costs have also
                    increased over the years. As rents get more expensive with inflation, investing in your own house
                    can shield you from inflation.

                    Benefits in interest rate- In the 90’s, banks used to charge up to 18% interest on loans. Today, you
                    are able to get a home loan at 7.65% annually. The decrease in the interest rates coupled with
                    capital appreciation makes it a dual benefit plan.

                    Tax benefits- The Government of India has played the biggest role in boosting the home loan sector.
                    As per Section 24B of the Income Tax Act 1961, you get a deduction of 2 Lakhs towards repayment of
                    interest towards loans availed for purchase/construction of house (if you or your family is living
                    in the house). At the same time, Section 80CC read with Section 80CCE of the Income Tax Act 1961
                    allows for a tax deduction up to 1.5 Lakhs on repayment of principal amount of the home loan. This
                    is one of the greatest incentives for people to opt for a home loan, even if you are able to afford
                    to buy your house with your savings.

                <p id="para-of-question"> After completing the above process, you can zero in on the loan provider. Keep

                    The lender will verify all your documents. The next step is the valuation and legal scrutiny. Banks
                    have their panel of evaluators and advocates to do this for them.

                    A personal discussion between the lender and the borrower is the next step on the agenda. The lender
                    usually meets the borrower at their residence to get first-hand information about the borrower’s
                    income, property, investments, and also the source of funds to meet the margin requirements. This is
                    a sort of a pre-sanction inspection carried out by the bank.

                    Once the verification and processing are over, banks provide you with a loan offer letter which
                    contains the terms and conditions of the sanction. In case you choose to accept them, you need to
                    sign one copy and deliver it to them followed by execution of the home loan documents. Money
                    Solution plays a big role in this regard and our experts will assist you every step of the way.

            <div class="content">
                <p id="para-of-question"> The Base Rate is the minimum rate at which the banks can sanction loans to its
                    customers. The RBI (Reserve Bank of India) does not permit banks to lend below the base rate. This
                    concept brings in a lot of transparency into the lending processes of the banks. The Base Rate
                    concept came into effect from July 01, 2010. From April 01, 2016, the RBI has introduced a new
                    methodology for calculating base rates. This is the MCLR concept. Banks have to set up five
                    different benchmarks depending on the time period (overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and
                    1-year). Various factors such as the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR), Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), the
                    Repo rates and the Reverse Repo rates influence the calculation of the MCLR. There are other factors
                    such as tenure premium, the marginal cost of funds, operating cost, negative carry on CRR and so
                    forth that affect the MCLR. These factors vary from bank to bank. Hence, each bank has its
                    individual MCLR.
