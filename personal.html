                    Loan. It is the most convenient option from the customer’s point of view. You do not need to
                    mortgage an asset for taking a Personal Loan.

                    No end use requirement -You can avail a Personal Loan for any purpose. There is no compulsion on
                    borrower’s part to disclose the use of funds. However, banks do take a declaration that you will not
                    use the loan for speculative purposes.

                    eligibility
                    criteria, you get a Personal Loan approval in a short period. Certain banks give online approvals
                    too.

                    Fixed Rate of Interest – Banks decide the rate of interest on personal financing at the time of
                    processing the loan application. It remains fixed throughout its tenure. Hence, you need not worry
                    about variable EMIs (Equated Monthly Instalments) or interest rate fluctuations.

                    Repayment flexibility -The average repayment period of a Personal Loan ranges from 36 months to
                    84
                    months. The more extended the loan repayment period, the lower the EMI. Individual financial
                    institutions allow you to repay the interest amount alone every month with the arrangement of paying
                    a pre-determined amount towards the principal repayment at the end of the year.
